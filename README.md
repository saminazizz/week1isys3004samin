Learning about html 
What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every web page. It’s a markup language - not a programming language - that describes the structure and content of web pages.

Key Distinctions
HTML Is	HTML Is Not
Declarative (describes what content is)	Programmatic (doesn’t execute logic)
Structure and meaning	Visual styling (that’s CSS)
Universal (all browsers understand it)	Platform-specific
Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage - it provides structure that CSS (skin) and JavaScript (muscles) build upon.
